# Intro_CC_Workshop
Projects and practice related to the competitive coding workshop.

PracticeConsoleApp1.cpp includes my notes from a C++ tutorial that may be found at https://www.sololearn.com/Play/CPlusPlus/

Most of the other lessons are derived from an Intro to Competitive Coding series taught by Greg LaKomski, ICPC of TX State Univ.
